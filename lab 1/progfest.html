    <h1>The Challenge</h1>

    <p>
        <u>
            This year's ProgFest will be different from prior years.
        </u>
        It consists of data structure and algorithm exercises within
        Android applications. The first part of the day will <br> be a 2
        hour hands-on workshop on creating very basic Android applications.
        The rest of the day will involve creating Android games that require
        the use of relatively <br> sophisticated algorithms and data structures.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            All exercises will be done in Java (with a small amount of XML) - a
            good grasp of Java is required.
        </li>
        <li>
            Knowledge of at least these Java data structures is needed: HashMaps, 
            ArrayLists, Sets, Trees, Tries.
        </li>
        <li>
            Knowledge of recursion would be helpful, along with algorithms such as 
            breadth-first search and depth-first search.
        </li>
        <li>
            Knowledge of basic text Java IO would also be helpful.
        </li>
        <li>
            Practice using Android Studio and deploying Android apps to an emulator 
            will make doing the projects
            easier. 
        </li>
    </ul>
